|  Your plan must be structured in sequential steps, with each step containing independent parallel      |

|  After receiving your plan, the system will execute ALL steps in your plan before asking for your      |

|  Steps are sequential, but each Step can have parallel subtasks.                                       |
|  For each Step, specify a description of the step and independent subtasks that can run in parallel.   |
|  For each subtask specify:                                                                             |

|  Do NOT invent new agents. Do NOT modify agent names. The plan will FAIL if you use an agent that      |

|  I apologize, but I'm encountering errors trying to directly access these APA style guide URLs. This   |
|  appears to be because these specific URLs either require authentication or are not publicly           |
|  accessible. The APA style guide is typically available through paid subscriptions or institutional    |
|  access.                                                                                               |
|                                                                                                        |
|  For the workflow to proceed, I recommend:                                                             |
|                                                                                                        |
|  1. Using publicly available APA style summaries from reliable sources                                 |
|  2. Or having the specific APA style rules provided directly in a local file                           |
|  3. Or accessing the APA style guide through proper institutional credentials                          |
|                                                                                                        |
|  Would you like me to try fetching APA style guidelines from alternative public sources, or would you  |
|  prefer to provide the style guidelines in a different format?                                         |
|                                                                                                        |

|  I notice I need to review a short story for grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors, but I don't    |
|  actually have access to the content of the short story yet. While the previous steps located the      |

|  I apologize, but I'm encountering errors trying to directly access these APA style guide URLs. This   |
|  appears to be because these specific URLs either require authentication or are not publicly           |
|  accessible. The APA style guide is typically available through paid subscriptions or institutional    |
|  access.                                                                                               |

|  1. Using publicly available APA style summaries from reliable sources                                 |
|  2. Or having the specific APA style rules provided directly in a local file                           |
|  3. Or accessing the APA style guide through proper institutional credentials                          |
|                                                                                                        |
|  Would you like me to try fetching APA style guidelines from alternative public sources, or would you  |
|  prefer to provide the style guidelines in a different format?                                         |

|  <fastagent:result>I'll help fetch the APA style guidelines from the specified URLs. Let me fetch      |
|  them using the fetch-fetch function.                                                                  |

|  Failed to fetch https://apastyle.apa.org/learn/quick-guide-on-references - status code 404            |
|  I apologize, but I'm encountering errors trying to directly access these APA style guide URLs. This   |
|  appears to be because these specific URLs either require authentication or are not publicly           |
|  accessible. The APA style guide is typically available through paid subscriptions or institutional    |
|  access.                                                                                               |

|  For the workflow to proceed, I recommend:                                                             |
|                                                                                                        |
|  1. Using publicly available APA style summaries from reliable sources                                 |
|  2. Or having the specific APA style rules provided directly in a local file                           |
|  3. Or accessing the APA style guide through proper institutional credentials                          |
|                                                                                                        |
|  Would you like me to try fetching APA style guidelines from alternative public sources, or would you  |
|  prefer to provide the style guidelines in a different format?</fastagent:result>                      |
