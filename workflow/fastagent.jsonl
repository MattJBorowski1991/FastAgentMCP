When printing this page, you must include the entire legal notice.\\\\n\\\\nCopyright \\xc2\\xa91995-2018 by The Writing Lab & The OWL at Purdue and Purdue University. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, reproduced, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed without permission. Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our terms and conditions of fair use.\\\\n\\\\nPlease use the example at the bottom of this page to cite the Purdue OWL in APA.\\\\n\\\\nYou can also watch our APA vidcast series on the Purdue OWL YouTube Channel.\\\\n\\\\n#### General APA Guidelines\\\\n\\\\nYour essay should be typed and double-spaced on standard-sized paper (8.5\\\\\" x 11\\\\\"), with 1\\\\\" margins on all sides. Include a page header (also known as the \\xe2\\x80\\x9crunning head\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) at the top of every page. For a professional paper, this includes your paper title and the page number. For a student paper, this only includes the page number. To create a page header/running head, insert page numbers flush right. Then type \\\\\"TITLE OF YOUR PAPER\\\\\" in the header flush left using all capital letters. The running head is a shortened version of your paper\\'s title and cannot exceed 50 characters including spacing and punctuation.\\\\n\\\\n#### Font\\\\n\\\\nThe 7th edition of the APA Publication Manual requires that the chosen font be accessible (i.e., legible) to all readers and that it be used consistently throughout the paper. It acknowledges that many font choices are legitimate, and it advises writers to check with their publishers, instructors, or institutions for guidance in cases of uncertainty.\\\\n\\\\nWhile the APA Manual does not specify a single font or set of fonts for professional writing, it does recommend a few fonts that are widely available. These include sans serif fonts such as 11-point Calibri, 11-point Arial, and 10-point Lucida Sans Unicode as well as serif fonts such as 12-point Times New Roman, 11-point Georgia, 10-point Computer Modern.\\\\n\\\\n## Major Paper Sections\\\\n\\\\nYour essay should include four major sections: the Title Page, Abstract, Main Body, and References.\\\\n\\\\n#### Title Page\\\\n\\\\nNote: APA 7 provides slightly different directions for formatting the title pages of professional papers (e.g., those intended for scholarly publication) and student papers (e.g., those turned in for credit in a high school or college course).\\\\n\\\\nThe title page should contain the title of the paper, the author\\'s name, and the institutional affiliation. A professional paper should also include the author note. A student paper should also include the course number and name, instructor name, and assignment due date.\\\\n\\\\nType your title in upper and lowercase letters centered in the upper half of the page. The title should be centered and written in boldface. APA recommends that your title be focused and succinct and that it should not contain abbreviations or words that serve no purpose. Your title may take up one or two lines. All text on the title page, and throughout your paper, should be double-spaced.\\\\n\\\\nBeneath the title, type the author\\'s name: first name, middle initial(s), and last name. Do not use titles (Dr.) or degrees (PhD).\\\\n\\\\nBeneath the author\\'s name, type the institutional affiliation, which should indicate the location where the author(s) conducted the research.\\\\n\\\\nA professional paper should include the author note beneath the institutional affiliation, in the bottom half of the title page. This should be divided up into several paragraphs, with any paragraphs that are not relevant omitted. The first paragraph should include the author\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name, the symbol for the ORCID iD, and the URL for the ORCID iD. Any authors who do not have an ORCID iD should be omitted. The second paragraph should show any change in affiliation or any deaths of the authors. The third paragraph should include any disclosures or acknowledgements, such as study registration, open practices and data sharing, disclosure of related reports and conflicts of interest, and acknowledgement of financial support and other assistance. The fourth paragraph should include contact information for the corresponding author.\\\\n\\\\nA student paper should not include an author note.\\\\n\\\\nNote again that page headers/page numbers (described above for professional and student papers) also appear at the top of the title page. In other words, a professional paper\\'s title page will include the title of the paper flush left in all capitals and the page number flush right, while a student paper will only contain the page number flush right.\\\\n\\\\nStudent APA title page\\\\n\\\\nTitle page for a student paper in APA 7 style.\\\\n\\\\nProfessional paper APA title page\\\\n\\\\nTitle page for a professional paper in APA 7 style.\\\\n\\\\n#### Abstract\\\\n\\\\nBegin a new page.

Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our terms and conditions of fair use.\\\\n\\\\n## Reference List: Basic Rules\\\\n\\\\nThis resource, revised according to the 7^th edition APA Publication Manual, offers basic guidelines for formatting the reference list at the end of a standard APA research paper. Most sources follow fairly straightforward rules. However, because sources obtained from academic journals carry special weight in research writing, these sources are subject to special rules. Thus, this page presents basic guidelines for citing academic journals separate from its \\\\\"ordinary\\\\\" basic guidelines. This distinction is made clear below.\\\\n\\\\nNote: Because the information on this page pertains to virtually all citations, we\\'ve highlighted one important difference between APA 6 and APA 7 with an underlined note written in red. For more information, please consult the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, (7^th ed.).\\\\n\\\\n## Formatting a Reference List\\\\n\\\\nYour reference list should appear at the end of your paper. It provides the information necessary for a reader to locate and retrieve any source you cite in the body of the paper. Each source you cite in the paper must appear in your reference list; likewise, each entry in the reference list must be cited in your text.\\\\n\\\\nYour references should begin on a new page separate from the text of the essay; label this page \\\\\"References\\\\\" in bold, centered at the top of the page (do NOT underline or use quotation marks for the title). All text should be double-spaced just like the rest of your essay.\\\\n\\\\n### Basic Rules for Most Sources\\\\n\\\\n* All lines after the first line of each entry in your reference list should be indented one-half inch from the left margin. This is called hanging indentation.\\\\n* All authors\\' names should be inverted (i.e., last names should be provided first).\\\\n* Authors\\' first and middle names should be written as initials.\\\\n\\\\n  + For example, the reference entry for a source written by Jane Marie Smith would begin with \\\\\"Smith, J. M.\\\\\"\\\\n  + If a middle name isn\\'t available, just initialize the author\\'s first name: \\\\\"Smith, J.\\\\\"\\\\n* Give the last name and first/middle initials for all authors of a particular work up to and including 20 authors (this is a new rule, as APA 6 only required the first six authors). Separate each author\\xe2\\x80\\x99s initials from the next author in the list with a comma. Use an ampersand (&) before the last author\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name. If there are 21 or more authors, use an ellipsis (but no ampersand) after the 19th author, and then add the final author\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name.\\\\n* Reference list entries should be alphabetized by the last name of the first author of each work.\\\\n* For multiple articles by the same author, or authors listed in the same order, list the entries in chronological order, from earliest to most recent.\\\\n* When referring to the titles of books, chapters, articles, reports, webpages, or other sources, capitalize only the first letter of the first word of the title and subtitle, the first word after a colon or a dash in the title, and proper nouns.\\\\n\\\\n  + Note again that the titles of academic journals are subject to special rules. See section below.\\\\n* Italicize titles of longer works (e.g., books, edited collections, names of newspapers, and so on).\\\\n* Do not italicize, underline, or put quotes around the titles of shorter works such as chapters in books or essays in edited collections.\\\\n\\\\n### Basic Rules for Articles in Academic Journals\\\\n\\\\n* Present journal titles in full.\\\\n* Italicize journal titles.\\\\n* Maintain any nonstandard punctuation and capitalization that is used by the journal in its title.\\\\n\\\\n  + For example, you should use PhiloSOPHIA instead of Philosophia, or Past & Present instead of Past and Present.\\\\n* Capitalize all major words in the titles of journals. Note that this differs from the rule for titling other common sources (like books, reports, webpages, and so on) described above.\\\\n\\\\n  + This distinction is based on the type of source being cited. Academic journal titles have all major words capitalized, while other sources\\' titles do not.\\\\n* Capitalize the first word of the titles and subtitles of journal articles, as well as the first word after a colon or a dash in the title, and any proper nouns.\\\\n* Do not italicize or underline the article title.\\\\n* Do not enclose the article title in quotes.\\\\n\\\\n  + So, for example, if \\\\n\\\\n<error>Content truncated.
