"Loook!" scremed Whiskers, his tale all poofed up wit exsitement. "Its a KASTL!!!!" The udder kittens stared in amazment. The kastl was soooo big it had like a millyon windos an turrets an stuff.

Socks, who was da bravest kitty, creeped forword frist. "Meow?" he sed cauciusly. The big stoney dors creaked open like they was inviting dem in. Mittens hidded behind a bush, to scaired to moov.

Wen they entur the kastl, everythin was dustee an old. Chandelears hanged from da seeling an weird payntings of strage peple watched dem. A mouse skitterd across da flor an Whiskers pounced, missng it by a wile.

"Dis is da weirdest plase EVAR!" exclamed Socks, rollin around on a dusty carpet. Mittens finnaly found her bravery an jumped up on a big throne, dekaring herself da QUEEN OF DA KASTL!!!

But then... a loud ROAR echoed thru da halls. Was it a dragan? A monstar? Or jus da wind? Da kittens hudeld togethar, their littl hart beating fast.
